      Udacious Travelers
===============================

Welcome to Justin Stout's Project 3 for the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree!

This game is a frogger clone where the objective is to reach a tile designated as the exit on the top row while avoiding bugs. The player will only complete the level by reaching this tile. Contact with a bug will result in losing a life.

Players can start by using the left and right arrows to select a character. There are five available characters. The player should press Enter after selecting his or her character.

Move the characcter by using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. You can press the q key at any time to reset the game; you will be prompted to be sure before resetting.

There are stars available on every stage that can be picked up for extra points. Players receive 10 points for completing a level and 5 points for collecting a star.

There are also hearts that randomly appear on one in five levels that add an extra life once picked up.

The game should be compatible with all major browsers. Enjoy!
